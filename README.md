Lab Assignments - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the code and explanations for the following labs:

Lab 1 - Pointers
Task: Create a program that declares an integer variable and a pointer to it. Modify the value of the variable using the pointer and display both the variable and pointer values.

Lab 2 - Big O Notation (Loops and Arrays)
Task: Implement a function that finds the maximum value in an array of size n. Determine its time complexity and explain why it is O(n).  

Lab 3 - Singly Linked List (Insert at End, Insert at Start)  
Task: Implement a singly linked list with functions to insert a node at the start and at the end. Display the list after each insertion.  

Lab 4 - Singly Linked List (Insert at Specific Location)  
Task: Write a function to insert a node at a specific position in a singly linked list, ensuring valid position handling.  

Lab 5 - Singly Linked List (Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to display the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.

Lab 6 - Singly Linked List (Delete Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to delete the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.

Lab 7 - Doubly Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a doubly linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.

Lab 8 - Merge two LinkedLists  
Task: 
1. Create 2 Singly LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.
2. Create 2 Double LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.

Lab 9 - Circular Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a circular linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.

Lab 10 - Stack with Linkedlist and Array
Tasks:
1. With Array; Push, Pop, Display 
2. With Linkedlist; Push, Pop, Display

Lab 11 - Queue with Linkedlist and Array
Tasks:
1. With Array; Enqueue, Dequeue, Display 
2. With Linkedlist; Enqueue, Dequeue, Display

Lab 12 -  BST and AVL
1. Insert and Traverse for BST
2. Insert and Traverse for AVL

Lab 13 -  DFS and BFS
1. Insert and Traverse for DFS in tree
2. Insert and Traverse for DFS in graph
3. Insert and Traverse for BFS in tree
4. Insert and Traverse for BFS in graph
