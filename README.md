Lab Assignments - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the code and explanations for the following labs:

Lab 1 - Pointers
Task: Create a program that declares an integer variable and a pointer to it. Modify the value of the variable using the pointer and display both the variable and pointer values.

Lab 2 - Big O Notation (Loops and Arrays)
Task: Implement a function that finds the maximum value in an array of size n. Determine its time complexity and explain why it is O(n).  

Lab 3 - Singly Linked List (Insert at End, Insert at Start)  
Task: Implement a singly linked list with functions to insert a node at the start and at the end. Display the list after each insertion.  

Lab 4 - Singly Linked List (Insert at Specific Location)  
Task: Write a function to insert a node at a specific position in a singly linked list, ensuring valid position handling.  

Lab 5 - Singly Linked List (Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to display the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.

Lab 6 - Singly Linked List (Delete Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to delete the first node, last node, Nth node, and centre node of a singly linked list.

Lab 7 - Doubly Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a doubly linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.

Lab 8 - Merge two LinkedLists  
Task: 
1. Create 2 Singly LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.
2. Create 2 Double LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.

Lab 9 - Circular Linked List (Insert & Display Nodes)  
Task: Implement functions to insert node at first, last, Nth location, and centre of a circular linked list. And display in order and display in reverse order.

Task: 
1. Create 2 Singly LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.
2. Create 2 Double LinkedLists and Merge them and display them.
